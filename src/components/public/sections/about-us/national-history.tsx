        Theta Tau was originally founded as the Society of Hammer and Tongs on
        October 15, 1904 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis by four
        young engineering students Erich J. Schrader, Elwin L. Vinal, William M.
        Lewis, and Isaac B. Hanks. Erich Schrader felt that engineering deserved
        a prominent professional fraternity similar to those that existed for
        lawyers, physicians, and dentists. Schrader’s service to the fraternity
        remains unmatched, having served as Grand Regent from 1904 to 1919,
        followed by 35 years as the Grand Scribe.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fifty years after its founding the Fraternity established the position
        of Counsellor to be held only by Erich Schrader at the Founders’ Golden
        Anniversary Convention. He held this position until his death in 1962.
        The remaining founders remained interested in Theta Tau throughout their
        lives until the last brother, Vinal, died in 1971.
        <br />
        <br />
        Erich Schrader was chiefly responsible for the Ritual, Constitution, and
        the Bylaws adopted by the founders. The first badge was a gold skull
        with the letters Θ and Τ on its forehead and a crossed hammer and tongs
        beneath. Schrader’s Constitution allowed for additional chapters at
        other engineering schools, with the hope that the organization would
        take on a national chapter.
        <br />
        <br />
        The oldest symbol of the fraternity still in use is the coat of arms,
        adopted in 1906, which may only be displayed or worn by members.
        <br />
        <br />
        Robert Downing, a friend of Isaac Hanks and student at Michigan College
        of Mines worked with Hanks to install the Beta chapter in 1906. In 1907,
        founder William Lewis transferred to the Colorado School of Mines and
        set up the Gamma Chapter in 1907. These three chapters held the first
        national conference in 1911, during which a new ritual was approved, the
        present badge adopted, and the name changed to Theta Tau. It was also
        decided that all branches of engineering would be included.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the next several years, new chapters continued to be installed. The
        second conference was held in 2013 and designated The Gear of Theta Tau
        as the fraternity’s magazine with Jack E. Haynes as its first
        editor-in-chief.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite the toll wars took on numbers, the fraternity continued to grow
        for many years. This growth continued in 1977, when a decision from the
        1976 national conference was implemented granting women membership in
        the fraternity, with the Delta Chapter from Case Western Reserve being
        the first to implement.
        <br />
        <br />
        By the time Theta Tau celebrated its centennial in 2004, more than
        30,000 members had been initiated. More than 20 new chapters have been
        installed and many more colonies certified since 2010, a testament to
        Theta Tau’s record growth in recent history.
