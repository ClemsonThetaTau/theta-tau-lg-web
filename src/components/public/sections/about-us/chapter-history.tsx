        The Lambda Gamma chapter of Theta Tau was founded by Scott Kultau, Jason
        Gamble, and Penn Sanders on January 13, 2001. The installment ceremony
        was conducted by the Grand Region at that time, Grand Regent Glen A.
        Wilcox.
        <br />
        <br />
        Throughout the years, Lambda Gamma has continued to grow without losing
        the core values of being a brotherhood of Theta Tau.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Lambda Gamma chapter of Theta Tau respect the culture of
        brotherhood, lifelong relationships, and connection, mutual respect and
        professionalism, balance of social, service, and professional
        activities, and diversity of engineering disciplines and demographics.
        <br />
        <br />
        The oldest symbol of the fraternity still in use is the coat of arms,
        adopted in 1906, which may only be displayed or worn by members.
